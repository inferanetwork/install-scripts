chmod +x ./infera-apple-m.sh
./infera-apple-m.sh
echo "alias init-infera='~/infera'" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

### Linux (Intel Build)

## Update and re-install

To update Infera on your computer, enter the following command into your Terminal to remove and replace
the depricated version of Infera.

### Apple M Series

rm -rf ~/infera
curl -O https://www.infera.org/scripts/infera-apple-m.sh
chmod +x ./infera-apple-m.sh
./infera-apple-m.sh
```

## Uninstall

```
rm -rf ~/infera
```

## Manage Models & Node

While the node is running, you can install ```llama3:latest``` with CLI using the following terminal
command in a second terminal window.

```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://localhost:11025/install_new_model' `
>> -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} `
>> -Method POST `
>> -Body '{"install_model_name": "llama3:latest"}'
```

The node should now have ```llama3:latest``` installed and your node is now fully operational on the network.

```llama3:latest``` can also be replace with the following models

```
gemma:latest
gemma2:latest
dolphin-mistral:latest
mistral:latest
llama3:latest
llama3.1:latest
llama2-uncensored:latest
```
Users can also user their browser and go to ```localhost:11025/docs``` to view the node API and see node stats and information.
Models can also be managed under the node API without having to use a terminal curl request.
